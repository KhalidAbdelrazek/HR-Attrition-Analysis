# 🧠 HR Employee Attrition Analysis

## 📋 Project Overview
This project explores key insights into employee attrition across various departments, demographics, and job levels.  
Using **Python**, **SQL Server**, and **Power BI**, I built a full data pipeline — from data cleaning and ETL to dashboard visualization — to uncover trends influencing employee turnover.
